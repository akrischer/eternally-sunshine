# eternally-sunshine

Eternally Sunshine is a Unity3D game developed in C#. It was developed as part of my curriculum as an undergraduate at Northeastern University.

## Where To Play

You can download a zipped file containing a Windows build of the game from [my Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P-j2qefdnsbpiSZ-fKlFRmFCs_HfjLaZ/view?usp=sharing). The zip contains an executable file and a folder which the executable requires. To play, simply run the executable.

You can also play this game by downloading this repository and opening it in the Unity editor. To play, load the **main_menu** scene and press play.

## Misc

This repository is structured like a Unity3D 2017.3.x project. You can open it using the Unity Editor like any typical Unity Project, and play/edit from there. The project uses a number of Unity Marketplace assets, which have been attributed in the credits scene.
