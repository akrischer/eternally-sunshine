My mind is a rollercoaster and I never want to jump off.
It feels so good to do another lap, sing another song, and write another track.
But I need to ride this for as long as I can, before it ends again.

When I was 6, I remember helping Grampa out on the docks.
He and I were the only ones in our family that enjoyed getting up so early,
and for so long...
My favorite part was the smell of a freshly opened crate of packed fish.
He called it "cologne of the working man."
I haven't been back there since before he died.

This[speed=2]...[/speed] this looks like where I wrote my very first song.
All I had was a guitar, a 30 rack of beer, and some good friends.
The song sucked, but I'll never forget how happy I felt that night.
