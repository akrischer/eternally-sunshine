[speed=60]My psycho thoughts rush up my spine, into my head, and back down to my feet.
It pushes me to run another lap, write another song.
I ride the rush while I can, because I know it will soon be gone.[/speed]

[speed=40] When I was 6, I remember helping Grampa out on the docks.
He and I were the only ones in our family that enjoyed getting up so early,
and for so long...[/speed]
[speed=25]My favorite part was the smell of a freshly opened crate of packed fish.
He called it "cologne of the working man."
I haven't been back there since before he died.[/speed]

This[speed=2]...[/speed] [speed=15]this looks like where I wrote my very first song.
All I had was a guitar, a 30 rack of beer, and some good friends.
The song sucked, but I'll never forget how happy I felt that night.[/speed]
